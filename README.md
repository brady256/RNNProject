# RNNProject

This is a project for the 2020 May Erdos Data Science Bootcamp.

It is an attempt to apply Recursive Neural Networks to historical 
economic data in order to predict when a recession will occur.

The US_Recession_Erdos notebook will create a pdout.csv (which is already in the repository) of 
selected and cleaned data from the provided Erdos_project_data_05.25.2020.xlxs file.
The excel data came from the Federal Reserve excel api FRED.


The RNNProj notebook will then take pdout and apply various RNNs using Keras and Tensorflow.
